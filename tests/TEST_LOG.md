# Unit Test Log — Red Ten Poker (红十)

Each time a bug is found and fixed, a targeted unit test is added to `tests/test_legal_moves.py`
and documented here with context, root cause, and fix summary.

## Test Case 1: Leading player must be able to play all valid combo types

**Date**: 2026-05-02  
**Reported by**: User  
**Source files**: `src/moves.py`, `web/play.html`

### Bug Description

When the player wins a trick (e.g., plays 大王 / big joker and everyone passes), they
become the leader for the next trick. All valid card combinations should be playable.
However, the Play button was grayed out when selecting 3 Queens (a triple), while
single cards worked fine.

### Root Cause (3 interrelated bugs)

1. **3-deck duplicate cards**: `build_deck()` uses 3 standard 54-card decks (162 cards
   total), so there are 3 identical copies of each card (same suit + same rank). `Card`
   is `@dataclass(frozen=True)`, so identical copies are equal and have the same hash.

2. **`frozenset` dedup collision**: The deduplication key was `frozenset(m.cards)`.
   With duplicates, `frozenset({Q♠₁, Q♠₂, Q♠₃})` collapsed to `frozenset({Q♠₁})`,
   which is the same key as the single Q♠ move. The triple was discarded as a "duplicate"
   of the single.

3. **Client exact-card matching**: `findMatchingMove()` compared exact card keys
   (`rl + '|' + suit`). With 4+ cards of the same rank in hand,
   `combinations(cards, 3)` generated multiple triple combos. The user's selection
   might not match any specific combo's exact card identities.

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/moves.py:_add_same_rank_combos` | Only generate 1 combo per rank, not all `C(n,k)` combinations |
| `src/moves.py:_add_triple_combos` | Same — 1 combo per rank |
| `src/moves.py` dedup logic | Changed key from `frozenset(m.cards)` to `(m.type, len(m.cards), frozenset(m.cards))` |
| `web/play.html:findMatchingMove` | Changed from exact card-key matching to sorted **rank-label** matching (ignoring suit) |

### Test Coverage

- `test_leading_all_combo_types` — Leading generates singles, pairs, triples, bombs
- `test_3deck_duplicate_rank_matching` — 3-deck duplicates don't break matching
- `test_pair_rank_matching` — Pair dedup works with duplicate cards
- `test_serialization_roundtrip` — Full server→JSON→client matching simulation

## Test Case 2: Red ten in pairs/triples must rank as regular 10

**Date**: 2026-05-02  
**Reported by**: User  
**Source files**: `src/moves.py`, `src/cards.py`

### Bug Description

When ♥10 (red ten) is used in a regular pair with another 10 (e.g., ♥10 + ♦10),
it should rank as a regular pair of 10s (rank=8), which cannot beat a pair of 2s (rank=13).
But the game allowed the pair of 10s to beat the pair of 2s because `single_rank()` returns
the elevated red-ten rank (16) for ♥10.

### Root Cause

`Card.single_rank()` returns the elevated rank (16) for red ten via the sentinel value.
This elevation is correct for **single cards** and **special bombs** (2-red-ten bomb,
3-red-ten bomb), but NOT for regular pairs/triples. The move generation functions
(`_add_same_rank_combos`, `_add_triple_combos`, `_add_triple_pair_combos`, `_bomb_key`)
all used `single_rank()` unconditionally.

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/moves.py:4 functions` | Replaced `combo[0].single_rank()` with `_SINGLE_RANK_MAP[int(combo[0].rank)]` — uses actual rank value, bypassing red ten elevation |

### Test Coverage

Implicitly covered by `test_leading_all_combo_types` (rank assertion) and regression
check in manual test run.

## Test Case 3: `your_turn` message double-nested card array

**Date**: 2026-05-02  
**Reported by**: User  
**Source files**: `src/room_manager.py`, `web/play.html`

### Bug Description

After server fix, the Play button remained grayed out for valid moves. User's selected
cards never matched any legal move.

### Root Cause

The `your_turn` WebSocket message serialized move cards as:
```python
"cards": ser_move(m)  # → {cards: [...], pass: ..., bomb: ..., desc: ...}
```
This double-nested the cards array inside the `ser_move` dict. The client code
`m.cards || []` returned the outer dict (truthy), not the inner array. Later,
`mCards.map(cardKey)` failed silently because dicts don't have `.map()`.

A previous fix had changed `m.cards ? m.cards.cards : []` (correct) to `m.cards || []`
(incorrect), misunderstanding the data structure.

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/room_manager.py:choose_action` | Changed `"cards": ser_move(m)` to `"cards": [ser_card(c) for c in m.cards]` — directly sends the card array |

### Test Coverage

Covered by `test_serialization_roundtrip` — verifies server→client matching with
the corrected flat card array format.

## Test Case 4: Red ten in 4+ card normal bomb

**Date**: 2026-05-02
**Reported by**: User
**Source files**: `src/moves.py`

### Bug Description

When leading, user has 4 tens including ♥10 (red ten). Game only allows playing
3 tens (without the red ten), not 4 tens as a bomb. Red ten should count as a
regular 10 in 4+ same-rank bombs, just like in pairs and triples.

### Root Cause

Two places in `src/moves.py` explicitly excluded red tens from normal bomb formation:

1. **`_add_bomb_combos` (line 582)**: `if not c.is_joker() and not c.is_red_ten():`
   filtered out red ten when grouping cards by rank. With 3 regular tens + 1 red ten,
   only 3 cards landed in the rank bucket, and `n < 4` skipped bomb generation.

2. **`_is_valid_bomb` (line 171)**: `if any(c.is_joker() or c.is_red_ten() for c in cards):`
   rejected any bomb candidate containing a red ten.

The comment on line 144 of `_bomb_key` already anticipated this case
("red-ten plays as 10 in normal bomb context") and correctly maps
`_SINGLE_RANK_MAP[int(Rank.TEN)]` → 7 for bomb rank — the rank logic was
already correct; only the card-gathering logic was overly restrictive.

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/moves.py:_is_valid_bomb` | Removed `or c.is_red_ten()` — only jokers are excluded from normal bombs |
| `src/moves.py:_add_bomb_combos` | Removed `and not c.is_red_ten()` — red tens participate in rank grouping |

### Test Coverage

- `test_red_ten_in_normal_bomb` — 4-card ten bomb (♥10 + 3 regular tens) is generated when leading with correct rank

## Test Case 5: Hand-end condition & scoring card transfer

**Date**: 2026-05-02
**Reported by**: User
**Source files**: `src/hand.py`

### Bug Description

1. Team scores don't add up to 300 per hand (e.g., Red 150 + Non-Red 110 = 260).
2. When one team's players all finish, the hand continues with remaining players battling until all 6 finish, rather than ending when one team is fully done.

### Root Cause

Three interrelated issues in `src/hand.py`:

1. **`_is_hand_over()` returned True at >= 5 finished**: When 5 players finished (e.g., 3 Red + 2 Non-Red), the hand ended, stranding the 6th player's unplayed cards. Any 5/10/K in their hand were never counted.

2. **`_check_terminal()` didn't return NORMAL**: It only returned GUAN_REN or SAN_HONG_SHI (when one team finishes AND the other has zero finishers). When the other team had some finishers, it returned None, allowing the hand to continue — but `_is_hand_over()` at 5 would prematurely end it.

3. **No leftover card scoring**: `_compute_result()` only summed `trick_scores` from actually-played cards. Unplayed scoring cards in mo_gong's hand were never transferred.

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/hand.py:_is_hand_over` | Changed `>= 5` to `>= 6` — safety net only |
| `src/hand.py:_check_terminal` | Return `TerminalKind.NORMAL` when one team fully done (even if other team has finishers) |
| `src/hand.py:_compute_result` | Before +/-60 adjustment, scan unfinished players' hands and transfer scoring card values to opposing team |

### Test Coverage

Manual verification: play a hand and confirm Red + Non-Red team scores sum to 300.

## Test Case 6: 末贡标签仅在牌局结束时判定

**Date**: 2026-05-02
**Reported by**: User
**Source files**: `web/play.html`

### Bug Description

游戏进行中，`finish_order` 中最后一位已完成的玩家被错误标记为"末贡"。例如第一位玩家出完（大贡），第二位玩家出完后立即显示"末贡"标识，但此时牌局尚未结束，末贡身份尚未确定。

### Root Cause

`renderGame()` 中对 `snap.fo` 中位置的计算：`pos === snap.fo.length-1 ? ' 末贡'` — 将当前已完成玩家的最后一位视为末贡，忽略了牌局仍在进行中的事实。

### Fix Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `web/play.html:renderGame` | 移除 `pos === snap.fo.length-1 ? ' 末贡'` 分支，游戏进行中仅显示"大贡"和序号 |

末贡判定由服务端 `HandResult.mo_gong` 在牌局结束时提供，客户端 `showHandEndOverlay()` 据此显示末贡标签。

### Test Coverage

手动验证：开始一局游戏，观察第二个完成玩家不再显示"末贡"，牌局结束覆盖层正确显示末贡。

## Test Case 7: 末贡未出牌展示

**Date**: 2026-05-02
**Reported by**: User
**Source files**: `src/state.py`, `src/hand.py`, `src/serializers.py`, `web/play.html`

### Feature Description

牌局结束后，在显示计分结果前，增加一个展示环节：在牌桌中央将末贡玩家手中未打出的牌面朝上展示，分牌（5/10/K）有金色光晕标记，鼠标悬停时牌面上提。点击"继续"按钮后进入计分结果界面。

### Implementation Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/state.py` | `HandResult` 新增 `mo_gong_hands: dict` 字段 |
| `src/hand.py` | `_compute_result()` 捕获末贡玩家剩余手牌传入 `HandResult` |
| `src/serializers.py` | `ser_result()` 新增 `"mg_hands"` 键，按玩家ID分组序列化 |
| `web/play.html` | 新增 `#mogong-display` 区域、`showMoGongDisplay()` 函数、卡片hover上提效果、"继续"按钮 |

末贡玩家无剩余牌（全员出完的关人情况）时直接进入结果界面。

### Test Coverage

服务端集成测试验证 `mg_hands` 正确包含末贡玩家剩余手牌。UI展示需手动验证。
